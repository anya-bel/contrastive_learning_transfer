cline,"Subspecies of the song sparrow form a cline in body size, plumage coloration, and song characteristics. There is a dramatic difference in appearance between the small, pale Melospiza melodia saltonis subspecies of the southwestern desert region and the large, dark Aleutian subspecies, M. m. maxima. It seems unlikely that the desert-dwelling subspecies saltonis would easily breed with the large Alaskan subspecies maxima, even if the ranges of the two subspecies were to overlap in the future. If some catastrophe completely eliminated the central west coast populations of the song sparrow, the northern and southern ends of the cline would likely become two distinct species of sparrow. Equus quagga is an extinct southern African mammal that resembled a zebra. . . Some observers considered it to be most closely related to the horse based on analyses of mainly cranial characters. Others thought it was a distinct species of zebra . . . Still others felt it was merely the southern end of a cline and a subspecies of the plains zebra. Both DNA and protein analyses of samples from quagga skin confirmed that it was, indeed, related to the plains zebra. The deme is the ultimate systematic unit of species in nature. In some cases, a deme may correspond to a subspecies, but it is almost always a decidedly smaller group. Demes do not enter into classification, because they do not have long-continuing evolutionary roles and because adjacent demes often have no observable differentiation.Demes often differ from one another in a geographic series of gradual changes. A gradual geographic shift in any one genetically controlled trait is known as a character cline. A series of samples from along a cline reveals a gradual shift in a particular character like body size, tail length, number of scales, or even intensity of coloration. Because such situations add to the difficulty of deciding the true phylogenetic relationships of populations, the experience and judgment of the systematist play an important role.","[A cline is a] character gradient, wherein a character such as length increases or decreases gradually and continuously. A cline distributed over geographic space is a \'chorocline\'; a cline distributed over time is a \'chronocline.\' Compare with chorospecies and chronospecies. . . Simpson termed the change through time a \'chronocline\', where a cline represents a character gradient. A chunk of a chronocline comprises a chronospecies.
